## Formalization : Complexity numbers are fixed functions points of algorithmic Complexity. 

Core Definitions

A tuple C = (R, U), where:
    - R represents the resolved universe:
      - The minimal Kolmogorov complexity 


In my system non-determinism and undecidability is mapped and explained by chaos and unknown unknown probabilities. 
 The first number or 1 would be  considered :
    - Problematic Universe Resolved By the Algorithm
        - The most efficient function for space, time and speed
        - the kolmogorov complexity of the problem ?
    - Problematic Universe Unresolved
        - Unknown probability function for space, time and speed
So the functions would be based on a specifically created distribution, i would call complexity distribution. 
Default by analysis of algorithmic complexity dataset of the Problematic universe? or Real set?
Metric : I'm defining by my formalization a complexity metric, but i will need an ordering between algorithms. 
I want to help write clearly and define the research paper when continuing reflections and providing my answers to you.
