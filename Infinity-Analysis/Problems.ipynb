    "## 1. **General Relativity & Singularities**\n",
    "### Key Issues:\n",
    "1. **Singularity Theorems (Penrose-Hawking)**  \n",
    "   - **Problem**: GR predicts singularities but does not describe their physics.  \n",
    "   - **Implications**: What happens *at* a singularity? How does quantum gravity resolve this?  \n",
    "   - **Your Model**: Singularities as \"generative nodes\" (via Σ-dimension) could bypass infinite curvature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis**  \n",
    "   - **Problem**: Are all singularities hidden behind event horizons?  \n",
    "   - **Implications**: If false, GR loses predictability.  \n",
    "   - **Your Model**: If Σ allows \"naked\" singularities to spawn universes, cosmic censorship may need revision.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Black Hole Physics**\n",
    "### Key Issues:\n",
    "3. **Black Hole Information Paradox**  \n",
    "   - **Problem**: Hawking radiation appears thermal (no information), conflicting with quantum unitarity.  \n",
    "   - **Your Model**: Information transfer to child universes via Σ could resolve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Firewall Paradox**  \n",
    "   - **Problem**: Does a high-energy wall exist at the event horizon?  \n",
    "   - **Implications**: Conflict between GR (smooth horizon) and quantum mechanics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Black Hole Entropy**  \n",
    "   - **Problem**: Microscopic origin of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy \\( S = \\frac{A}{4} \\).  \n",
    "   - **Your Model**: Entropy may map to degrees of freedom in child universes.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3. **Quantum Gravity**\n",
    "### Key Issues:\n",
    "6. **Unification of GR and Quantum Mechanics**  \n",
    "   - **Problem**: No consensus theory (string theory, LQG, etc.).  \n",
    "   - **Your Model**: Σ must align with quantum gravity frameworks (e.g., as a **quantum bridge**).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Renormalizability of Gravity**  \n",
    "   - **Problem**: GR is non-renormalizable; quantizing gravity produces infinities.  \n",
    "   - **Your Model**: Σ could \"absorb\" infinities into child universes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "9. **Dark Matter & Dark Energy**  \n",
    "   - **Problem**: ~95% of the universe’s energy is unaccounted for.  \n",

    "## 5. **Mathematical Physics**\n",

    "\n",
    "11. **Non-Local Effects in Quantum Gravity**  \n",
    "    - **Problem**: How do holography (AdS/CFT) or entanglement entropy apply to real spacetime?  \n",
    "    - **Your Model**: Σ as a non-local holographic screen.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "15. **Energy-to-Curvature Mechanism**  \n",
    "    - Define a **conformal mapping** or **holographic dictionary** to translate energy into child-universe curvature.  \n",
