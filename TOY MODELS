Publish a Toy Model: Demonstrate your theory on a simple problem (e.g., sorting algorithms) to show its predictive power.

To test your theory, let’s design toy models that are simple enough to analyze but rich enough to demonstrate your framework’s potential. Below are actionable ideas for experiments, datasets, and visualizations, along with tools to implement them.

1. Toy Model: Sorting Algorithms
Why Sorting?
Well-understood time/space complexities (e.g., quicksort 
O
(
n
log
⁡
n
)
O(nlogn), bubble sort 
O
(
n
2
)
O(n 
2
 )).

Clear "resolved" (optimal) and "unresolved" (heuristic) cases.

Setup
Resolved Universe:

Kolmogorov-optimal algorithm: Merge sort (deterministic, minimal program length).

Metric: Encode merge sort’s time/space as 
R
=
(
K
opt
,
Time
,
Space
)
R=(K 
opt
​
 ,Time,Space).

Unresolved Universe:

Non-deterministic algorithm: Bogosort (chaotic, probabilistic shuffling).

Complexity distribution 
D
(
P
)
D(P): Model runtime as a heavy-tailed distribution (e.g., Pareto) due to its randomness.

Test
Phase Transition:

Vary input size 
n
n. Plot when 
D
(
P
)
D(P) (bogosort’s runtime variance) diverges from 
R
R (merge sort’s predictable runtime).

Metric Validation:

Define 
C
1
⪯
C
2
C 
1
​
 ⪯C 
2
​
  if merge sort’s 
R
R stochastically dominates bogosort’s 
D
(
P
)
D(P). Verify transitivity/antisymmetry.

2. Toy Model: 3-SAT Problems
Why 3-SAT?
Classic NP-hard problem with phase transitions (hardness peaks at clause/variable ratio ≈ 4.26).

Setup
Resolved Universe:

Optimal DPLL algorithm (deterministic, exponential time).

R
=
R= Kolmogorov complexity of DPLL.

Unresolved Universe:

Probabilistic local search (e.g., WalkSAT).

D
(
P
)
D(P): Runtime distribution near phase transition thresholds.

Test
Complexity Singularity:

Generate SAT instances with varying clause ratios. Show that 
D
(
P
)
D(P) (WalkSAT’s runtime) becomes chaotic/unpredictable near the phase transition.

Visualization:

Plot instances in a "complexity space" with axes: clause ratio vs runtime variance. Highlight regions where 
D
(
P
)
D(P) diverges.

3. Toy Model: Cellular Automata (Chaos and Undecidability)
Why Cellular Automata?
Simple rules can generate chaotic or undecidable behavior (e.g., Rule 110 is Turing-complete).

Setup
Resolved Universe:

Predictable automata (e.g., Rule 90: linear, analyzable).

R
=
R= Kolmogorov complexity of its evolution.

Unresolved Universe:

Rule 110 (chaotic, Turing-complete).

D
(
P
)
D(P): Distribution of halting times for initial configurations (analogous to the Halting Problem).

Test
Undecidability as Singularity:

Show that for Rule 110, 
D
(
P
)
D(P) has unbounded variance (no algorithm can predict halting for all inputs).

Metric:

Define 
C
1
⪯
C
2
C 
1
​
 ⪯C 
2
​
  if Rule 90’s 
R
R is computable while Rule 110’s 
D
(
P
)
D(P) is not.

4. Tools for Implementation
Simulation and Analysis
Python Libraries:

numpy/pandas for data, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.

scipy.stats to model distributions (e.g., fit 
D
(
P
)
D(P) to power-law or exponential).

Complexity Metrics:

Use lzma compression as a proxy for Kolmogorov complexity (shorter compressed size ≈ simpler algorithm).

Chaos Theory:

Compute Lyapunov exponents for chaotic algorithms (e.g., using nolds Python library).

Existing Datasets
Algorithmic Complexity:

SATLIB for 3-SAT instances.

DIMACS for graph/traveling salesman problems.

Chaotic Systems:

UCI Time Series Repository for benchmarking unpredictability.

5. Questions to Answer with Toy Models
Does 
D
(
P
)
D(P) exhibit phase transitions?

Test: Compare sorting runtimes for 
n
=
10
n=10 vs 
n
=
1000
n=1000. Does variance explode?

Can we map "singularities" to undecidability?

Test: Show that Rule 110’s 
D
(
P
)
D(P) cannot be reduced to 
R
R-like metrics.

Does the metric 
⪯
⪯ align with intuition?

Test: Verify that merge sort 
⪯
⪯ bogosort, but not vice versa.

6. Example Workflow
Implement Merge Sort vs Bogosort:

Collect runtime distributions for 1000 random arrays.

Compress their implementations with lzma to estimate Kolmogorov complexity.

Visualize Complexity Numbers:

Plot each algorithm as a point in 2D space: 
x
=
Time
x=Time, 
y
=
Compressed Size
y=Compressed Size.

Shade regions where 
D
(
P
)
D(P) (bogosort) becomes unpredictable.
